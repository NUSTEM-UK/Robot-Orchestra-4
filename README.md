# Robot-Orchestra-4

Version of the Robot Orchestra, autumn 2018, for a five-week Maker Club run at St. Wilfreds College, South Shields, UK.

Plans as of 2018-10-24:

* Copper pipe glockenspiel, likely servo-actuated (or possibly solenoid?).
* Drive system from previous RTTTL-based requests handlers.
* Alternatively, drive system from Sonic Pi via OSC.

In principle, OSC control should be lower-latency, and relying on Sonic Pi for sync/tempo control should actually work, in comparison to the earlier Python version which is a comparatively rubbish drummer.
