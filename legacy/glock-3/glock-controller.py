"""Glockenspiel controller -- taking RTTTL requests from glock-requests.

Elements drawn from Pimoroni Piano HAT code:
https://github.com/pimoroni/Piano-HAT/blob/master/examples/simple-piano.py

Parses RTTTL, commands the rest of the system, and handles servo playback
using pigpiod for better PWM handling on Pi. Need to ensure:

  sudo pigpiod

...before running.

Python3 (log2 pre-installed rather than loaded from math module)

Dependencies (all `pip3 install`):
    pygame
    paho-mqtt

Other dependencies:
    curl -sS get.pimoroni.com/displayotron | bash
